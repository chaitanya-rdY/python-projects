One day, my friend <name> and I decided to go to the zoo. We were very excited to see all the <plural noun>. When we got there, the first thing we saw was a huge <animal>. It was <adjective> and looked very <adjective>.

We moved on to see the <plural noun>. They were <verb ending in "ing"> around and making a lot of noise. My favorite part was when we saw the <animal>. It had <number> <plural noun> and a very <adjective> <body part>.

At lunchtime, we decided to eat some <food>. It was very <adjective> and <adjective>. After lunch, we went to the gift shop and bought a <noun> as a souvenir.

On our way home, we couldn't stop talking about the <adjective> day we had. We both agreed that the next time we would bring <name of person> with us.
